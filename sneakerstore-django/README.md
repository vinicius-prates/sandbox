# sneakerstore

  A Web aplication with a crud to add sneakers. 
  > Back-end: django, rest framework. <br>
  > Front-end: React.
  
  API is already done and the front end style is done aswell. I'm having a lot of trouble to POST to the back-end through the front-end.
  With this project i learnt a lot of styled components and rest framework.
